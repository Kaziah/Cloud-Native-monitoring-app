This DevOps project showcases the power of containerization and Kubernetes orchestration

This project uses Python, HTML, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Docker.

I've designed this project to demonstrate best practices for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications on AWS infrastructure.
